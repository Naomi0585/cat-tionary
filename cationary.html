    <p>There are many types of Domestic Shorthair breeds, for this occasion I've chose the notorious American Shorthair orange tabby! These little rascals are very friendly, personable and easygoing. Because of their simple maintenance they have generally good health and this allows them to have a longer life expectancy than most cats. They are independent which means they will find ways to entertain themselves while alone. Finally, they have a strong hunting instinct that makes them be very playful.</p>
